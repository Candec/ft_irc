I am working with netcat as my IRC Client
--- apt install netcat

@link to the site and documentation:
https://netcat.sourceforge.net/


Roadmap and recommended order:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- Establish a working client/server socket connection,
2- Add the signals handling (CTRL+C, CTRL+D, CTRL+Z);
3- Client registration system (NICK, USER, PASS),
4- Server commands (PING, OPER, KILL...) and
5- Channel operations commands (JOIN, PART, INVITE, KICK, PRIVMSG, NOTICE...).

Use insert in maps
Fix user.getChannel (i.e.: in rpl_list())
Make sure all rpl_ and err_ functions are mapped to the switch statements
Debug privmsgCmd

Test commands:
	PASS
	NICK works
	USER
	COLOR
	JOIN
	QUIT
	CAP
	TOPIC
	PRIVMSG
	AWAY
	PING
	MODE
