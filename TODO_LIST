I am working with netcat as my IRC Client
--- apt install netcat

@link to the site and documentation:
https://netcat.sourceforge.net/


Roadmap and recommended order:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- Establish a working client/server socket connection, 
2- Add the signals handling (CTRL+C, CTRL+D, CTRL+Z); 
3- Client registration system (NICK, USER, PASS), 
4- Server commands (PING, OPER, KILL...) and 
5- Channel operations commands (JOIN, PART, INVITE, KICK, PRIVMSG, NOTICE...).
